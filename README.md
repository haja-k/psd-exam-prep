## ‚òÑÔ∏è Tips
- pay attention to keywords. e.g: "sprint backlog" vs "product backlog"
- memorize basic timeboxed events 

There are many code metrics. Some of them measure code quality and others just prepare information about code situations.
Metrics that measure code quality: Class Coupling, Depth of Inheritance, Efferent Coupling, Afferent Coupling, Instability Index, Cyclomatic Complexity, Maintainability Index.
Metrics that do not measure code quality: Code Coverage, Lines of Code
